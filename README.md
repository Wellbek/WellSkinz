## How to use? 

Open the .exe in CSGO and the rest should be self explainatory.

## It's not working

When it's not working than CSGO changed something or the offsets are outdated.
You can update the offsets by pasting from hazedumper (https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/csgo.hpp).

## Please note:

This is just a three day project and is far from perfection. There are a lot of bugs and the code is not clean nor the most efficient. I'm not interested to further work on this project.
